# Numerical Generalized Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for piecewise smooth target densities

This repository contains the codes for the methods considered and simulations done in "Numerical Generalized Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for piecewise smooth target densities" (Tran and Kleppe, 2025). 

The folder `disc_grad` contains the scripts to implement the method described in Section 3 and reproduce the numerical examples and illustrations presented in Sections 3, 5 and 6. 

The folder `piecewise_smooth` containts the scripts to implement the method described in Section 4 and reproduce the numerical examples and illustrations presented in Sections 4, 5 and 6. 

The folder `sticky` containts the scripts to implement the sticky GRHMC mentioned in Section 6 and some further examples related to this process that are not reported in the manuscript. 

Note that certain `.RDS`-outputs are removed due to size issues.
